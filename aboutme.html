			Hello! I'm Alvin, a sophomore in Stuyvesant High School.
			<br/></br>
			I was born in 2004, and for pretty much my whole life I've lived in a quiet nook of New York City called Forest Hills. I went to local schools until 7th grade, when I was
			accepted into Hunter College High School. It was a cool place. I stayed there until 9th grade, when I went to Stuyvesant. I've been here ever since.
			<br/><br/>
			My interests mainly lie in the fields of mathematics, physics, and computer science. I like to explore cool problems in these fields, and for computer science I've made some
			cool little side projects. I've participated in competitions in all these fields. Overall, I'm quite happy with what I'm doing.
			<br/><br/>
			Some generic pictures of these things:

			</center>
			<br/><br/><br/><br/>
			Aside from academic interests, I also like to play basketball and chess. Oftentimes, I'll just noodle around on the internet. Sometimes, I'll find a cool article worth reading.

			I hope you enjoyed learning about me. Go visit one of the other tabs!
